# OpenWriter
### A free theme for Ghost

I created this theme as a way to learn how Ghost works. It is available for free. If you use the theme or have any suggestions for improvements, do tweet me at [@ireaderinokun](https://twitter.com/ireaderinokun)!

## Getting Started

If you are completely new to Ghost, you should read their [documentation here first](https://github.com/tryghost/Ghost). Otherwise, continue reading!

To install this theme, simply download this repo as a zip file, extract, and place in your themes directory. In your Ghost backend, go to 'settings' and select the OpenWriter theme.


## Key features

- Clean design with parallax scroll

### Contact Form

Thanks to [Formspree](http://formspree.io), I was able to include a free contact form by default. To use it, follow these steps:

1. Create a new post
2. Title the post 'Contact' and make sure the post URL is also 'contact'
3. Under the settings, check the box that says "Turn this post into a static page"
4. Publish
5. Visit the Contact page and fill in the form once to activate it with Formspree

The email the contact form will send to is determined by the post Author's email, so choose your author carefully.

### Cover Images

Each page features a cover image. This is determined by the following hierarchy:

1. The individual page's cover image
2. The blog's cover image
3. The default cover image bundled with the theme

Special thanks to [The Stocks](http://thestocks.im/) for providing the default cover image under the Creative Commons Zero licence.
